# National Pokédex by [Raúl Espinosa Gómez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raulespinosagomez/)

This is my version of the Pokémon National Pokédex, heavily inspired by the Pokédex from Pokémon Scarlet & Violet.

## Development Stack

This project was built using Vite, React, Tailwind, and GSAP. It helped me strengthen my skills with these technologies and get started with GSAP.

## Planned updates and features
- Improved design for desktop browsers.
- More Pokémon forms to be added (e.g., Furfrou hairstyles, Flabébé colors).
- And many more to come...
